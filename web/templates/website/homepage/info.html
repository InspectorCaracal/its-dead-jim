<p><em>NEXUS</em> is a text-based roleplaying game, set in an alternate future metropolis where magic is real and corporate capitalism dominates society. Players can choose one of several magical archetypes and create highly customizable characters - some during character creation, with further customization as you play.</p>
<p>The buffet-style gameplay is primarily slice of life, with a side of action. Skill-based progression lets you play whatever and however you like, with a deep highly-customizable crafting system supporting everything from street fashion trends to virtual-reality cybercorporate heists.</p>
<p>Roleplaying is required, but there's no quality standards to meet - keep your topics and behavior in-universe, but don't stress over the details. We're all here to have fun!</p>
