# The game is dead, long live the game

Here lies the remains of a three-year endeavor to create a new kind of text-based game experience built on [Evennia](https://evennia.com), now lost to scope creep and unavoidable life changes.

### What the heck

I was building a cyberpunk game using evennia but I've had to abandon it. As I promised myself I would if this should ever come to pass, I'm making all my code available for other evennia devs to ~~steal from~~ reference, as the pure, unpolished, glorious monstrosity of code which I created.

## Credits

- Alephate from [Song of Avaria](https://songofavaria.com) gave me the original base code for the forum, which I significantly modified.
- owllex from [Secrets of Aelandris](https://aelandris.org) gave me the `Note` model which I built `Scene` off of
- Some of the handlers and properties and stuff were once core Evennia code which I copied and horribly disfigured for my own nefarious purposes.

## Licensing?

I dunno. The most "do what you want" thing I'm allowed to do considering aforementioned sources? Use common sense, don't be an asshole, yadda yadda. Credit if you use whole systems I wrote would be nice but I literally will never check.
