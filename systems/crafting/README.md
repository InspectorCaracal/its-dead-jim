## `use tool`

Crafting is initiated by using a crafting tool and choosing from the presented options.

### Crafting Tools
* sewing needle - sewing, tailoring
* embroidery needle - embroidery
* knitting needles - yarn work
* crochet hook - yarn work, lace work
* hammer - carpentry
* saw - carpentry
* chisel - carpentry, wood carving
* knife - wood carving, cooking
* stove + pan - cooking
* oven - cooking


Top-down recipe objects:

* each recipe is for the final object
* each final object is made of components
* each component is potentially made of other components
* when the crafting recipe is defined, it totals all of those base component ingredients and tools for validation
* when the crafting recipe is used, it walks down the tree one branch at a time to craft the base components


for patterns and designs and such i should probably include a timegated command you can use to unlock a new pattern or design you haven't encountered

New Materials/Weaves:

Silk - Raising mulberry silkworms could be included in animal husbandry or ideally through weaving. You would need woven fiber boxes, leaves/plant fiber to feed them. You could check daily to see if there are cocoon fibers to harvest and then spin thread to create “silk thread”.
Cloth-of-metal - take threads of metal and weave them around yarn threads

Weave silk - noil, gauze, damask, charmeuse, brocade, organza, satin, raw, samite, tulle, velvet
Weave wool - twill, flannel, challis, broadcloth, felt, homespun, tartan, tweed
Weave cotton - fustian, muslin, moleskin, linen, canvas (needs to be treated), cambric, barkcloth, lace

Subtypes of existing recipes:
(could take more cloth depending on the cut)

Dress - cotehardie, gown, kirtle, houppelande, shift, undergown, underdress, chemise, overgown

Customization

I think it would be awesome if tailored items could have 1 tailoring adjustment and 1 embellishment. Tailoring adjustments would remark on the style of the garment, how it has been specially cut. Embellishment would be what has been added to the garment after it has been cut/sewn.

Tailoring adjustments examples:

Sleeves - bell-shaped, trailing, floor-length, cap, bloused, slashed, cuffed, trumpet, sleeveless, dolman, elbow-length, flounced

Hems - calf-length, knee-length, floor-length, cathedral-length, trailing, pooling, cascading

Fit - loose, baggy, fitted, tight, narrow, svelte, tailored, backless

Collars - open, low, high, flared, stiff, short, tall, pointed, band, wingtip, button-down

Neckline - plunging, strapless, illusion, halter, square, v, off-shoulder, asymmetrical, scoop

Embellishments examples:

Buckles, buttons, beads, laces, hemming, trim, underskirts, lining, clasps, fringe, studs
